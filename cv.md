### About myself
From the middle of 2021, I started the path of learning in IT - I tried to write my first programs, and dragged on.
At this time, I spend almost all my free time studying and working(as a sales manager atm) with short breaks for rest. 
In addition to courses, I read books (Clean Code, Grokking Algorithms), watching videos on YouTube for 
better understanding of complex topics. Now in the process of learning frontend development with Rs.school and soon i`ll be 
ready for work as a junior frontend developer.

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.
C#
```
public class Kata
{
  public static string DoubleChar(string s)
  {
            char[] charArray = s.ToCharArray();

        char[] doubleCharArray = new char[(charArray.Length)*2];

        int Counter = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < charArray.Length; i++)
        {
            doubleCharArray[Counter] = charArray[i];
            Counter++;  
            doubleCharArray[Counter] = charArray[i];
